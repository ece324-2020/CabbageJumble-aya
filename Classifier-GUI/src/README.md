## To save
- Press `Spacebar`
- Make sure to save before moving on to the next picture
- Adjust the count (right now it is at 0, and see the title before saving, make sure the image matches the title name to be saved to)
- The txt files will have "-1" as placeholders (this means it is unlabelled)

## Configure
- Configure stuff in  ``config.py`` as usual
- this time it does not save any images, just txt files
