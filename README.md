# CabbageJumble-aya

## Introduction
Comedically inspired by the thought of paying with a wheelbarrow of coins, Cabbage Jumble-ayaâ€™s goal is to count the value of coins in a pile, given only an image. 

## Functionality and Limitations
Cabbage Jumble-aya counts coins given a picture

### 

## Major Roadblocks!
-[ ] Baseline segmenter breaks for touching coins/ coins partially outside view
-[ ] Labelling areas and training data
-[ ]
